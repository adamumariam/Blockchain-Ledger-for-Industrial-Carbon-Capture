# 🌍 Blockchain Ledger for Industrial Carbon Capture

Welcome to a revolutionary blockchain solution for tracking and verifying industrial carbon capture! This project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a transparent ledger that verifies carbon storage, mints verifiable carbon credits, and enables seamless cross-border transfers. It addresses real-world challenges like climate accountability, fraud in carbon markets, and barriers to international carbon trading by providing immutable proofs and automated compliance.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Immutable recording of carbon capture events  
✅ Third-party verification of storage integrity  
💰 Minting of tokenized carbon credits based on verified data  
🌐 Cross-border credit transfers with built-in compliance checks  
📊 Real-time auditing and reporting for regulators  
🚫 Anti-fraud mechanisms to prevent double-counting  
🔄 Integration with oracles for off-chain data (e.g., sensor readings)  
📈 Scalable for global industrial adoption  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle the end-to-end process of carbon capture tracking. Industries capture CO2, submit data for verification, receive credits, and trade them internationally—all on-chain for transparency.

**For Carbon Capturers (Industries)**  
- Register your facility and submit capture data (e.g., tons of CO2 captured) via the CaptureRegistry contract.  
- Use an oracle to feed real-world sensor data for initial validation.  
- Request verification from certified auditors.  

**For Verifiers (Auditors)**  
- Review submitted data and confirm storage using the StorageVerifier contract.  
- Approve minting of credits once storage is verified.  

**For Traders and Regulators**  
- Minted credits can be transferred domestically or across borders using TransferManager and CrossBorderGateway.  
- Query the ledger for audits or compliance reports at any time.  

The system ensures no double-counting by hashing unique capture events and enforcing unique IDs. Cross-border transfers automatically check against international standards (e.g., via governance-updatable rules).

## 📂 Smart Contracts Overview

All contracts are written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain, ensuring security and Bitcoin-anchored finality. Here's a breakdown of the 8 contracts:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**  
   Registers participants (industries, verifiers, regulators) with roles and KYC-like metadata. Prevents unauthorized access.

2. **CaptureRegistry.clar**  
   Allows industries to register carbon capture events, including amount captured, timestamp, and unique hash of supporting documents.

3. **OracleIntegrator.clar**  
   Interfaces with external oracles to input real-world data (e.g., IoT sensor readings for capture validation) securely.

4. **StorageVerifier.clar**  
   Handles verification workflows where auditors confirm long-term storage (e.g., geological sequestration) and mark events as verified.

5. **CreditMinter.clar**  
   Mints ERC-721-like NFTs or fungible tokens representing carbon credits only after verification, tied to capture events.

6. **TransferManager.clar**  
   Manages domestic transfers of credits, with checks for ownership and anti-double-spend logic.

7. **CrossBorderGateway.clar**  
   Facilitates international transfers by enforcing compliance rules (e.g., tax implications, emission standards) via on-chain logic.

8. **GovernanceHub.clar**  
   Allows DAO-style governance for updating parameters like verification standards or oracle sources, ensuring the system evolves with regulations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Deploy the contracts on Stacks testnet using Clarinet.  
2. Interact via the Stacks wallet or custom frontend.  
3. Test a full flow: Register → Capture → Verify → Mint → Transfer.  

This project empowers industries to monetize carbon capture while building trust in global climate efforts. Let's capture carbon and credits—on-chain!
